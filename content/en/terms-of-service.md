# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025* 🚀

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "**this site**" or "**we**"). Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By hitting up or using our site, you're agreeing to these terms. Got it? 👍

## 1. About Our Services
This site offers cool paid subscription content and exclusive membership services. We're talking blog posts, special resources, e-books, and even community interaction – and that's just the tip of the iceberg! Some of this awesome content is just for our subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
Users, listen up! You'll need a valid email address and a password to snag an account.
Your account security and all activities under it are *your* responsibility. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account – that's a big no-no!
We reserve the right to **suspend or terminate** user accounts if anyone breaks these rules. Heads up! 🙅‍♀️

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
Subscription services are billed monthly or annually, and you'll see all the deets on the checkout page. Easy peasy.
All payments zoom through third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. Don't sweat it, this site never stores your payment info.
Your subscription will **automatically renew**, so if you wanna bail, make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
**14-Day Refund Policy**: First-time subscribers, if you're not totally stoked with our service, you can grab a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email at the bottom of these terms and tell us what's up. Each user gets one shot at a refund. If it's been more than 14 days or you're not a first-timer, sorry, **no refunds** after payment, unless the law absolutely says we have to. 💸

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
All original content is **copyrighted by this site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our permission. Capiche?
Users only get **non-exclusive, non-transferable access** for your personal learning and reading pleasure.
Wanna use something commercially or quote a bunch? Please hit us up to get authorization first.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
**Prohibited**: Uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Seriously, don't do it. 🚫
**Prohibited**: Bulk downloading, scraping, or trying to hack into member content using tech tricks. We're watching!
This site can remove any inappropriate content and will **ban violating users**. You've been warned!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services anytime, without notice. Just so you know.
If, by some crazy chance, content becomes temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server glitches, or third-party service outages, this site **won't be on the hook for compensation**. Bummer, we know.

## 7. Disclaimer
Information provided by this site is just for reference, folks! It **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). So don't take it as gospel.
This site **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just keeping it real.

## 8. Governing Law
These Terms of Service are ruled by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA 🇺🇸, without looking at its conflict of law principles.
Any disputes popping up from or related to these terms? Let's try to chat it out first, amicably. If that doesn't work, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California.
